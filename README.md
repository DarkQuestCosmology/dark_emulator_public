A repository for a cosmology tool `dark_emulator` to emulate halo clustering statistics. The code is developed based on Dark Quest simulation suite (https://darkquestcosmology.github.io/). The current version supports the halo mass function and two point correlation function (both halo-halo and halo-matter cross).

## Install
In order to install dark emulator package, use pip:
```
   pip install dark_emulator
```
or use conda:
```
   conda install -c nishimichi dark_emulator
```
Please note that updates on conda are currently halted due to an unresolved issue in conda build. Therefore, we recommend using the version in pip or installing from the source using the following command.

If the above does not work for you, you may download the source files from this repository and install via
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
after moving to the top directory of the source tree.
In that case, you need to install `george` (a software package for the Gaussian process) and colossus
```
conda install -c conda-forge george
pip install colossus
```
From version 1.1.0, `dark_emulator` uses FFTLog implementation by [Fang et al (2019); arXiv:1911.11947](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11947).
