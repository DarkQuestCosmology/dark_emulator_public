Dark Emulator's documentation
=====================================

Dark emulator is a cosmology code for calculating summary statistics of large scale structure constracted as a part of Dark Quest Project (https://darkquestcosmology.github.io/).
The "dark_emulator" python package enables fast and accurate computations of halo clustering quantities. The current version supports the halo mass function, halo-matter cross-correlation, and halo auto-correlation as a function of halo masses, redshift,
separations and cosmological models.

See the :doc:`tutorial` for an introductory set of examples of how to use the DarkEmulator package.
This is usually the fastest way to learn how to use it and quickly see some of the capabilities.
When you use the HOD module, you can quickly learn the module with :doc:`tutorial-hod`.
